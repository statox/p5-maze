# P5-maze

Some fun with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and maze generator and solver algorithms.

[Click here for the demo](http://www.statox.fr/p5-maze/)

# TODO

Stuff I want to do:

 - [ ] Fix the color superposition when several solvers run in parallel
 - [ ] Implement a way to display stats of each solvers on a same maze (number of visited cells, execution time, efficiency, ...)
 - [ ] Implement a way to determine the complexity of the generated maze
 - [ ] Implement more generators to have different ways to generate a maze (mazes with loops, with several solutions, ...)
 - [ ] Implement more solvers (A\*, wall follower, Pledge, ...)
 - [ ] Add a bit of explanations on the home page of the project and document how to add solvers and generators
 - [ ] Maybe improve the UI so that it doesn't look like it was made by a backend developer
